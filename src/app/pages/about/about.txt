          Valentina's work plays around the surprise of what is possible to make
          with a simple and thin line: a thread. Coming from a family with a
          strong feminine tailoring tradition, she wanted to bring this
          passionate root into her jewellery world, finding new ways of working
          with textiles. She weaves freely thousands of meters of threads on a
          hyclrosoluble fabric, cutting or interlacing them one with the other,
          to let unexpected connections appear. Her approach is both
          experimental and traditional: she likes to combine contemporary
          methods with ancient techniques, like Filigree. The latest work was
          chosen by the "Triennale Design Museum" in Milan to be part of the
          exhibition "W. Women in Italian design" (April 2016- February 2017).

          The Brand FLOEMA is a new jewelry brand all design and handmade by
           me, Valentina Caprini, goldsmith, and artist based in Florence.
           The name FLOEMA is inspired by the vascular tissue of the plants,
           which brings the lifeblood from the roots to the branches and
           makes flowers and fruits bloom. Each FLOEMA piece is elegant and
           unique, created with a refined goldsmith's technique in a small
           laboratory equipped with machines dated to the beginning of the
           '900. Like the lifeblood makes the plant evolve, so FLOEMA gives
           part of its income to PLAN INTERNATIONAL, a charity that works
           hard to eliminate the child brides phenomenon.

           The surprise of what is possible to make with a simple and thin thread.
            Jewelry Care All FLOEMA jewels are exclusively realized using precious
            metals: 925 silver (pure for the Filigree) and 18kt gold. All metals are
            subjected to a natural oxidation process, that depends either on natural
            factors like oxygen in the air, the salt in the sea, sunlight, skin ph, or
            on chemical factors, like creams and perfumes. Please find two ways to clean
            gold and silver with natural ingredients, To make your piece return to its
            original condition: Gold is slightly subjected to the oxidation process.
            To make your jewel shine again put your jewels in a solution of half cup
            of white vinegar and salt for at least 30 minutes. With a white cotton soft
            cloth dipped in the solution first brush your piece and then rinse it with
            plenty of water and voila! To take the oxidation off silver you have to use
            one ingredient only: bicarbonate. Pour 250m1 of lukewarm water and 5
            spoons of bicarbonate in a container. Mixed until it is melted. Leave your
            silver jewels in the solution over the night, then brush them with a
            toothbrush until they shine again. Finally, rinse and dry with soft cloth.


            Sustainability FLOEMA engages in its own small way to choose green solutions
            as much as possible. You will receive each piece in a handmade box realized
            by Florentine typography using eco-friendly paper (made by 90% of pure
            cellulose and 10% by cotton fibers), in a recycled and 100% recyclable
            parcel. The business cards are realized with recycled cotton fiber cardboard.
            All the pieces are created in a small laboratory in the Florentine countryside,
            preferring using green materials and recycling precious materials.
